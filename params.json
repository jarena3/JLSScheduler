{"name":"JLS Homework Utility","tagline":"Automatic homework and handout generator for JLS LS-level classes","body":"[Jump to Tutorial](#howto)\r\n\r\n#Overview\r\n\r\nThe JLS Homework Utility / JLS Scheduler is a tool that automates the creation of useful handouts for JLS LS-level classes. You input class and student information (including Korean names, which can be parsed from lpt.gojls excel files, see [Importing JLS Excel Data](#jls-excel)), and you get these printable (.DOCX, .DOC, .PDF, .XLS, .HTML, or .ODT) files:  \r\n+ A class syllabus, student list, and homework tracker for yourself\r\n+ A homework list for the class' KT\r\n+ Personalized homework sheets for each student, with...\r\n+ A syllabus for Mom and Dad, complete with Korean introduction\r\n\r\nThe tool allows for saving and loading of specialty .JLSC files to save class data to work on later, or send to other teachers. It allows for the [addition of custom classes](#json-edit), automatically detects Korean national holidays and JLS breaks and adjusts the homework schedule to account for them, and allows for any amount and configuration of singular and repeating homework assignments.  \r\n\r\n###Please note\r\nThis tool, while developed with older systems in mind, will just not be able to run on really old OSes. This being Korea, some of the machines here (in my branch, at least) run 14-year-old operating systems. If you *do* get this program to run on one of these, I can't guarantee everything will work. The recommended specifications are:  \r\n+ Windows 7 or 8\r\n+ Microsoft Word 2013 (if you want to export to formats other than .DOCX)  \r\n    *Exporting to .DOC (not .DOCX) files will still require MS Word to be installed on the system, but any version should be okay.*\r\n\r\nI have no idea what minimum specifications are. If you can get it to run, you're probably good to produce at least .DOCXes.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"howto\"></a>\r\n###How-to\r\n\r\nStuff here\r\n\r\n<a name=\"jls-excel\"></a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<a name=\"json-edit\"></a>\r\n###Adding Custom Class Levels and Times\r\n\r\nStuff here\r\n\r\n###Bugs\r\n\r\nStuff here","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
